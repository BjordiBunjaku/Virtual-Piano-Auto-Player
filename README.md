# Virtual-Piano-Auto-Player
Simple virtual piano auto player written in c++. If there are any bugs, me noob. Feel free to use it.

Note: Tested only on Windows Roblox and virtualpiano.net.

# Small update:

Ability for the program to play [abc def] notes and white and black keys at the same time.

Tiny improvements and other things I forgot.
