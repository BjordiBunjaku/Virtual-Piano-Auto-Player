# Virtual-Piano-Auto-Player
Simple virtual piano auto player written in c++. If there are any bugs, me noob. Feel free to use it.

Note: Tested only on Windows Roblox and virtualpiano.net.

Small update: Now it should play white and black keys at the same time (added mutex as tiny delay).
              Ability for the program to play [abc def] notes.
              Tiny improvements and other things I forgot.
